# WordPress Starter Theme
### IN DEVELOPMENT

My WordPress Starter Theme is not a production ready template.  It is intended for use as a boilerplate for those wishing to build a custom WordPress theme using modern(ish) development tools and practices.  This template assumes you have at least basic knowledge of WordPress, PHP, SCSS and JavaScript.

##### Installation
run ```bower install --save && npm install --save-dev```
